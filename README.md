## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, travel has become an integral part of our lives, and the demand for efficient flight booking systems is higher than ever. 
However, existing booking platforms often lack flexibility and real-time updates, leading to inconvenience for both travelers and administrators. 
To address these challenges, there is a need for a modern and comprehensive flight booking system.

## Solution

The flight booking system aims to provide users with a seamless and user-friendly experience for booking flights, while also offering administrators powerful tools for managing flight schedules. Key features of the system include:

**User Interface:**

Flight Search: Users can search for flights based on criteria such as departure and arrival cities, dates, and preferred airlines.

Booking Process: The system facilitates a smooth booking process, allowing users to select their desired flights, seats, and add-ons (e.g., meals, baggage allowance)

**Admin Panel:**

Flight Management: Administrators have the ability to manage flight schedules, including adding new flights, updating existing ones, and canceling or rescheduling flights when necessary.

User Management: Administrators can oversee user accounts, handle bookings made by users.
